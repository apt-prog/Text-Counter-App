# Text-Counter-App

ðŸ‘‹ Hey Connections!
Hope you're all doing well and building awesome things! Today, Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase my new mini project â€“ a smart and sleek TextCounter App ðŸ§ âœ¨

ðŸ’¡ Project Title: TextCounter App â€“ Realtime Character Tracker

Perfect for content limits, form validation, or palindromic experiments! ðŸ§ª

âœ¨ Key Features
âœ… Real-time character tracking on input
âœ… Smooth and responsive design using Bootstrap
âœ… Glassy, elegant UI with hover glow effects
âœ… Mobile-first layout and fully optimized
âœ… Typography powered by Google Fonts for a modern feel
